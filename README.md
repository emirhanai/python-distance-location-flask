# python-distance-location-flask
It is an inter-position distance software supported by FLASK that I created with Python. This software also shows round-trip times between locations.

Systematic, FLASK and Maps API supported python software that measures the distance between two locations.

1) First run the emirhan-project.py file.
2) Then type any location and press enter.
3) Login to 127.0.0.1:5000.
4) On the screen you log in, you will see the kilometer between two locations and how long it takes by car.
